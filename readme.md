# Day 45 Task | Cohort 2.0
This project is my **Day 44 Task**, where I built a **Random Motivational Text Generator** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

With every click, a new **vibrant, rotated, scaled, randomly placed text** appears on the screen, helping me practice **DOM manipulation**, **dynamic styling**, and **randomization** in JavaScript.

## 📌 About the Day 44 Task
Day 44 focused heavily on experimenting with JavaScript’s **Math.random()** and DOM features such as:

- Creating elements dynamically  
- Controlling position, rotation & scale  
- Applying CSS styles through JS  
- Working with arrays of text  
- Understanding how randomness affects UI behavior  

This task boosted my confidence in creating **fun interactive UI elements** with JavaScript.

## ✨ Task Description

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Random Text Generator** | Picks a random motivational line from an array of 10 custom texts. |
| 🎨 **Random Colors** | Each generated `<h1>` gets a fully random RGB color. |
| 🔄 **Random Rotation** | Random rotation between 0°–360°. |
| 🔍 **Random Scale** | Text sizes change with random scaling. |
| 🧭 **Random Position** | Text appears anywhere on the screen. |
| 🖱️ **Interactive Button** | Clicking the button generates a new styled text. |
| 🌈 **Full-Screen Playground** | Clean UI with full-window display. |


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling & button UI  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Random logic, DOM manipulation  
- **VS Code / Browser** – Development workflow  


## 📖 Learning Outcome
Through this task, I learned how to:

- Create and insert elements dynamically using JavaScript  
- Use `Math.random()` for creative UI outcomes  
- Change CSS properties like position, color, scale, and rotation via JS  
- Work with arrays to generate different text outputs  
- Build interactive UI without external libraries  

This task improved my understanding of **DOM manipulation + creative styling**.

## 🌟 Acknowledgement
This task helped me grow in **frontend development**, especially in understanding randomness, styling, and UI interaction.  
Thanks for the constant guidance and motivation.
